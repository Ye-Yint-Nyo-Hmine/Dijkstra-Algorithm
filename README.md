# Dijkstra-Algorithm
A simple dijkstra algorithm for my school project, to find the fastest path from each classes for incoming freshmans,

## For Use
Create a .json file with a graph

eg. for rooms(my school example)
```
{
{
  "room1": {"room2": 3, "room3": 2},
  "room2": {"room1": 4, "room3": 3},
  "room3": {"room1": 2, "room2": 1},
}
```
